	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>Presented in the United States House of Representatives by Representative James Madison of Virginia, this amendment was the second of the twelve Constitutional amendments originally submitted to the state legislatures for ratification by the 1st Congress on September 25, 1789, the last ten of which became the United States Bill of Rights on December 15, 1791.
               <p>
               From 1789 to 1791, the compensation proposal was ratified by the legislatures of only six states—Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Delaware, Vermont and Virginia —ten being required at the time. As more states entered the Union, the ratification threshold increased. In 1873, more than 80 years after Congress offered it to the nation's state lawmakers, the Ohio General Assembly ratified the compensation amendment as a means of protest against the "Salary Grab Act".<sup>[1]</sup> The Salary Grab Act not only provided for a Congressional pay raise, but made that raise retroactive.
               <p>
            <li>Under the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in <em>Coleman v. Miller</em> (1939), any proposed amendment which has been submitted to the states for ratification and does not specify a ratification deadline may be ratified by the states at any time. In Coleman, the Supreme Court further ruled that the ratification of a constitutional amendment is political in nature—and so not a matter properly assigned to the judiciary.
                   <p>
                   The proposed amendment resurfaced in 1978 where it was ratified by Wyoming as a protest to a congressional pay raise. It was then largely forgotten before University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student Gregory Watson wrote a paper on the subject in 1982.<sup>[2]</sup> Despite receiving a 'C' grade on his paper by an instructor who deemed his idea 'unrealistic',<sup>[3]</sup> Watson started a new push for ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures.<sup>[1]</sup>
                   <p>
                   At the time Watson commenced his campaign only eight states were known to have ratified the amendment (although it was later discovered that Kentucky had ratified the amendment in 1792). The first legislature to ratify as a result of Watson's campaign was Maine in April 1983, followed by Colorado in 1984. Numerous state legislatures followed suit, and the ratification by Michigan on May 7, 1992 provided the 38th known state ratification (Kentucky's 1792 ratification having been missed) required for the archivist to certify the amendment.
