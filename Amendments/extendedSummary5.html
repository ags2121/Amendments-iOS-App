    <h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
            <li>The Fifth Amendment contains clauses which protect against certain abuses in legal procedure. Among them are the Double Jeopardy Clause, Self-Incrimination Clause, Due Process Clause, and the Takings Clause.
                <p>
            <li>The protections in the Fifth Amendment can be traced back to the Magna Carta, a 1215 charter which required King John of England to proclaim certain liberties and accept that his will was not arbitrary, that punishments could not be meted except through the law of the land. This was the first document forced onto a King of England by a group of his subjects, the feudal barons, in an attempt to limit his powers by law and protect their privileges.
                <p>
            <li>Both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments contain a Due Process Clause. In the latter, the clause has been used to make most of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, as well as to recognize substantive and procedural rights.
