	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>When the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists were originally debating for the inclusion of a Bill of Rights in the Constitution, the Federalists argued that a listing of rights could problematically enlarge the Governments powers specified in the new Constitution by implication; Alexander Hamilton asked, "Why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?." The Ninth Amendment was a solution to this issue by clarifying that the inclusion of specific rights in the Constitution does not necessarily deny or diminished other, unenumerated rights.
                <p>
            <li>The Ninth Amendment has generally been regarded by the courts as negating any expansion of governmental power on account of the enumeration of rights in the Constitution, but the Amendment has not been regarded as further limiting governmental power. 
                <p>
            <li>Additionally, in <em>Gibson v. Matthews</em> (6th Cir. 1991) the court argued that the Ninth Amendment doesn't confer any particular set of rights to the people, but rather is intended to invalidate the maxim of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</em>, which states that the express mention of one thing excludes all others: "The ninth amendment does not confer substantive rights in addition to those conferred by other portions of our governing law. The ninth amendment was added to the Bill of Rights to ensure that the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</em> would not be used at a later time to deny fundamental rights merely because they were not specifically enumerated in the Constitution."
