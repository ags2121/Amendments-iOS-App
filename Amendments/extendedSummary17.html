	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>Under the original provisions of the Constitution, senators were elected by state legislatures; this was intended to ensure that the federal government contained representatives of the states, and also to provide a body not dependent on popular support that could afford to "take a more detached view of issues coming before Congress".<sup>[1]</sup>
               <p>
               Over time, however, various issues with these provisions, such as the risk of corruption and the potential for electoral deadlocks or a lack of representation should a seat become vacant, led to a campaign for reform.
               <p>
            <li>Reformers tabled constitutional amendments starting in 1828, with the issues finally reaching a head during the 1890s and 1900s. Progressives, such as William Jennings Bryan, called for reform to the way senators were chosen. Elihu Root and George Frisbie Hoar were prominent figures in the campaign to maintain the state legislative selection of senators.
                <p>
                By 1912, with a campaign for a state-led constitutional amendment gaining strength, and a fear that this could result in a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution">runaway convention</a>", the proposal to mandate direct elections for the Senate was finally introduced in the Congress.
