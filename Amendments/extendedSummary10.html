	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>The Tenth Amendment makes explicit the idea that the federal government is limited only to the powers granted in the Constitution.
               <p>
               It has been declared to be truism by the Supreme Court. In <em>United States v. Sprague</em> (1931) the Supreme Court asserted that the amendment "added nothing to the [Constitution] as originally ratified."
               <p>
               States and local governments have occasionally attempted to assert exemption from various federal regulations, especially in the areas of labor and environmental controls, using the Tenth Amendment as a basis for their claim.
               <p>
            <li>The Supreme Court rarely declares laws unconstitutional for violating the Tenth Amendment. In <em>New York v. United States</em> (1992), for only the second time in 55 years, the Supreme Court invalidated a portion of a federal law for violating the Tenth Amendment.
                <p>
                The case challenged a portion of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, which provided incentives for states to comply with statutory obligations to provide for the disposal of radioactive waste. The first two incentives were monetary, whereas the third made each state liable for all damages directly related to the waste.
                <p>
                Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the federal government can encourage the states to adopt certain regulations through the spending power (e.g. by attaching conditions to the receipt of federal funds), or through the commerce power (by directly pre-empting state law) but cannot directly compel states to enforce federal regulations.
                <p>
            <li>Despite the Supreme Court having explicitly rejected the idea that the states can nullify federal law, several states have introduced various resolutions and legislation in protest to federal actions.
                <p>
                Some significant recent legislation include various firearm protection acts and preemptive federal gun law nullication bills; the 2012 legalization of Marijuana in Washington and Colorado which conflicts with federal prohibitions; and the various efforts by Republican states to nullify certain provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.
