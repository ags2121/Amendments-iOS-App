	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>The Constitution left the boundaries of suffrage undefined. The only directly elected body created by the original Constitution was the House of Representatives, for which voter qualifications were explicitly delegated to the individual states. At that time, all states denied voting rights to women (with the exception of New Jersey, which initially carried women's suffrage but revoked it in 1807).
               <p>
               While scattered movements and organizations dedicated to women's rights existed previously, the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention in New York is traditionally held as the start of the American women's rights movement. Suffrage was not a focus of the convention, however, and its advancement was minimal in the decades preceding the Civil War.
               <p>
               The issue of suffrage took hold in the period after the Civil War, where women's rights leaders advocated for inclusion of universal suffrage as a civil right in the Reconstruction amendments. When this failed, suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony and their organization the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) brought court cases arguing that the 14th and 15th amendments together served to guarantee voting rights for women.
               <p>
               When three Supreme Court decisions from 1873 to 1875 rejected this argument, their group shifted to advocating for a new constitutional amendment.
               <p>
            <li>Susan B. Anthony with the assistance of Elizabeth Cady Stanton drafted the text of the Nineteenth Amendment. The proposed amendment was first introduced in the Senate, colloquially as the "Anthony Amendment", by Republican Senator Aaron A. Sargent of California.
                <p>
                Sargent, who had met and befriended Anthony on a train ride in 1872, was a dedicated women's suffrage advocate. He had frequently attempted to insert women's suffrage provisions into unrelated bills, but did not formally introduce a constitutional amendment until January 1878.
                <p>
                Stanton and other women testified before the Senate in support of the amendment. The proposal sat in a committee until it was considered by the full Senate and rejected in a 16 to 34 vote in 1887.
                <p>
                A three-decade period known as "the doldrums" followed, during which the amendment was not considered by Congress and the women's suffrage movement achieved few victories.<sup>[1][2]</sup>
                <p>
                Starting in 1910, most western states began passing legislation or voter referenda enacting full or partial suffrage for women.<sup>[2]</sup> These successes were linked to the 1912 election, which saw the rise of the Progressive and Socialist parties, as well as the election of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson.
                <p>
                The amendment was considered again a few times starting in 1914 until ultimately in was passed on August 18th, 1920, with Tennessee narrowly provided the final ratification (50 yay, 49 nay).
