    <h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>The language of the Eighth Amendment is almost identical to a provision in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which declared, "as their ancestors in like cases have usually done...that excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." The provision was largely inspired by the case in England of Titus Oates who was sentenced to imprisonment including an annual ordeal of being taken out for two days pillory plus one day of whipping while tied to a moving cart.
                <p>
            <li>According to Supreme Court precedent, the Eighth Amendment forbids certain punishments entirely, and forbids some other punishments that are excessive when compared to the crime, or compared to the competence of the perpetrator. The definition of cruel punishment is amorphous and evolves with the era. For instance, In <em>Wilkerson v. Utah</em>, (1878), the Court stated that death by firing squad was not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Today many critics cite drug sentencing and three strikes laws as being grossly disproportionate to the offense and in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
                <p>
            <li>In <em>United States v. Bajakajian</em>, (1998), the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to take $357,144 from a person who failed to report his taking of more than $10,000 in US currency out of the United States. In what was the first case in which the Supreme Court ruled a fine to violate the Excessive Fines Clause, the Court held that it was "grossly disproportional" to take all of the money which Mr. Bajakajian attempted to take out of the United States. In describing what constituted "gross disproportionality," the Court could not find any guidance from the history of the Excessive Fines Clause and so relied on Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause case law.
