	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>The Eighteenth Amendment was the result of decades of organizing and lobbying by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_temperance_movement_in_the_United_States">temperance movement</a> and at the time was generally considered a progressive amendment.<sup>[1]</sup> Many state legislatures had already enacted statewide prohibition prior to the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment.
               <p>
               Following the amendment's adoption, prohibition resulted in a public demand for illegal alcohol, making criminals of producers and distributors. The police, courts and prisons were overwhelmed with new cases; organized crime increased in power, and corruption extended among law enforcement officials.
               <p>
               <li>The amendment and its enabling legislation did not ban the consumption of alcohol, but made it very difficult to obtain alcoholic beverages legally, as it prohibited the sale and distribution of them in U.S. territory. Certain liquors were excluded from prohition, i.e. liquors intended for for medical and religious purposes.
                   <p>
                <li>The Amendment was the first amendment to set a time delay before it would take effect following ratification, and the first to set a time limit for its ratification by the states.
