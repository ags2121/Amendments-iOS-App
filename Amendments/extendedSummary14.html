	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>Section 1 formally defines citizenship of the United States and protects individual civil and political rights from being abridged or denied by any state. In effect, it nullified the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision that black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had just granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power. The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted this principle enshrined into the Constitution to protect the new Civil Rights Act from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and to prevent a future Congress from altering it by a mere majority vote.
               <p>
               The section was also in response to the Black Codes that southern states had passed in the wake of the Thirteenth Amendment. The Black Codes attempted to return former slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court.
               <p>
            <li>Due process deals with the administration of justice and thus the Due Process Clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the Government outside the sanction of law. Beginning with <em>Allgeyer v. Louisiana</em> (1897), the Court interpreted the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as providing substantive protection to private contracts and thus prohibiting a variety of social and economic regulation, under what was referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_contract">"freedom of contract"</a>.
                <p>
                However, the Court did uphold some economic regulation such as state prohibition laws (<em>Mugler v. Kansas</em>, 1887), laws declaring maximum hours for mine workers (<em>Holden v. Hardy</em>, 1898), laws declaring maximum hours for female workers (<em>Muller v. Oregon</em>, 1908), President Wilson's intervention in a railroad strike (<em>Wilson v. New</em>, 1917), as well as federal laws regulating narcotics.
                <p>
                By the latter half of the 20th century, nearly all of the rights in the Bill of Rights had been applied to the states, under what is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights">incorporation doctrine</a>. The Supreme Court has held that the amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates all of the substantive protections of the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth (except for its Grand Jury Clause) and Sixth Amendments and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The Seventh Amendment has been held not to be applicable to the states.
                <p>
            <li>Section 2 altered the way how much representation each state receives in the House of Representatives is determined. It counts all residents for apportionment, overriding Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, which counted only three-fifths of each state's slave population.
                <p>
                It also reduces a state's apportionment if it wrongfully denies any adult male's right to vote, while explicitly permitting felony disenfranchisement. However, this provision was never enforced while the southern states continued to use various pretexts to prevent many blacks from voting right up until the passage of Voting Rights Act in 1965. Because it protects the right to vote only of adult males, not adult females, this clause is the only provision of the US Constitution to discriminate explicitly on the basis of sex.
                <p>
                Some have argued that Section 2 was implicitly repealed by the Fifteenth Amendment, but the Supreme Court has acknowledged the provisions of Section 2 in recent times. For example, in <em>Richardson v. Ramirez</em> (1974) the Court cited Section 2 as justification for the states disenfranchising felons. In his dissent, Justice Marshall explained the history of the Section 2 in relation to the Post-Civil War Reconstruction era, how felon disenfranchisement was a compromise solution that allowed Southern states their full apportionment while giving them easy method of disenfranchising their black male population.
                <p>
            <li>Section 4 confirmed the legitimacy of all United States public debt appropriated by the Congress. It also confirmed that neither the United States nor any state would pay for the loss of slaves or debts that had been incurred by the Confederacy.
                <p>
                For example, during the Civil War several British and French banks had lent large sums of money to the Confederacy to support its war against the Union. In <em>Perry v. United States</em> (1935) the Supreme Court ruled that under Section 4 voiding a United States government bond "went beyond the congressional power."
