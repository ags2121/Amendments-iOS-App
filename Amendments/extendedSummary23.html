	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>The Constitution's rules for the composition of the House of Representatives and the Senate explicitly grant seats to states, and no other entities. Similarly, electors to the electoral college are apportioned to states, not to territories or the federal district.
               <p>
               The main reference to the federal district is in Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution which gives Congress the power "To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States."
               <p>
               In the early existence of the District, it was too small and rural to merit a hypothetical seat in the House of Representatives anyway, with fewer than 30,000 inhabitants.
               <p>
            <li>In 1890, a bill was introduced into Congress to grant Washington, D.C. voting rights in presidential elections; it did not proceed forward, however. Around this time Theodore W. Noyes, a writer of the Washington Evening Star, published a number of stories in support of D.C. voting rights. Noyes also helped found the Citizens' Joint Committee on National Representation for the District of Columbia, a citizen's group which lobbied Congress to pass an amendment expanding D.C. voting rights. After his death in 1846 the Citizens' Joint Committee continued onward, and the issue of District voting rights began to be seen as similar to the civil rights movement.
                <p>
                By 1960 District voting rights seen as a politically neutral, pro-civil rights measure. The 23rd Amendment was passed by Congress and sent to the states on June 16, 1960. It was ratified only 286 days later.
                <p>
            <li>The amendment restricts the district to the number of Electors of the least populous state, irrespective of its own population. As of 2011, that state is Wyoming, which has three Electors. However, even without this clause, the district's present population would only entitle it to three Electors.
                <p>
                Since the passage of this amendment, the District's electoral votes have gone towards the candidates of the Democratic Party in every presidential election.
                <p>
                DC electors are still unable to send voting Representatives or Senators to Congress.
