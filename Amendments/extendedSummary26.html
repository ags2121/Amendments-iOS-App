	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his 1954 State of the Union address, became the first president to publicly state his support for prohibiting age-based denials of suffrage for those 18 and older.<sup>[1]</sup>
               <p>
               On June 22, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed an extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required the voting age to be 18 in all federal, state, and local elections. Subsequently, Oregon and Texas challenged the law in court. In <em>Oregon v. Mitchell</em> (1970), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the parts of the law that required states to register 18-year-olds for state and local elections. Justice Hugo Black stated:
               
               <p class="indent"><em>"I would hold that Congress has exceeded its powers in attempting to lower the voting age in state and local elections."</em> <sup>[2]</sup></p>
               
               At this time, only four states had a minimum voting age below 21; 18 for Georgia and Kentucky, 19 for Alaska and 20 for Hawaii.
               <p>
               This ruling meant that the law could only apply to federal elections, which meant states would have to have separate voting rolls for voters between 18 and 20 years old and special ballots for them to vote on federal races.<sup>[3]</sup>
               
            <li>Congress and the state legislatures felt increasing pressure to pass the Constitutional amendment because of the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. "Old enough to fight, old enough to vote," was a common slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced its roots to World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the military draft age to eighteen.
                <p>
                On March 10, 1971, the Senate voted 94–0 in favor of proposing a Constitutional amendment to guarantee that the voting age could not be higher than 18.<sup>[4]</sup> On March 23, 1971, the House of Representatives voted 401–19 in favor of the proposed amendment.<sup>[5]</sup> Within four months after the Congress submitted it to the states the amendment was ratified, the shortest time in which any proposed amendment has received the number of ratifications needed for adoption.
