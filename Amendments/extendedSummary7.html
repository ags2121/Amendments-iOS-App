    <h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>Prior to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, English judges were seen as servile creatures of the King. Whereas English judges won their independence from the Crown in the Act of Settlement 1701, American colonial judges still served at the pleasure of the King.
               <p>
               When King George III of Great Britain abolished trial by jury in the Colonies it was one of the main grievances precipitating the American Revolution.
                <p>
            <li>The Re-Examination Clause of the seventh amendment forbids any court from reexamining or overturning any factual determinations made by a jury, unless the factual determinations are clearly erroneous.
                <p>
            <li>No power was defined to index or adjust for inflation the $20 threshold defined in the amendment; if the sum was adjusted, it would be several hundred U.S. dollars as of 2011.
                <p>
                Congress has never extended federal diversity jurisdiction to amounts that small, and the amendment is one of the few portions of the Bill of Rights never to have been incorporated by the Supreme Court of the United States.
                <p>
                Under the current Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the amount in dispute in diversity cases must exceed $75,000 USD in order for the case to be heard in federal court.
                <p>
            <li>
                Whereas colonial judges routinely instructed jurors that they were the ultimate arbiters of both fact and law, the modern judge asserts an almost plenary control over the evidence, law, and facts, instructing the jury as to what the law is, and may overturn decisions in favor of the defense.
