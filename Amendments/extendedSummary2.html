    <h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Supreme Court ruled on several occasions that the amendment did not bar state regulation of firearms, considering the amendment to be “a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the National government and not upon that of the States.”
               <p>
               Along with the incorporation of the Second Amendment in the 21st century, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess and carry firearms.
               <p>
               This represented the first time since the 1939 case <em>United States v. Miller</em> that the Supreme Court had directly addressed the scope of the Second Amendment.
               <p>
           <li>In 2008 and 2010, the Court issued two landmark decisions to officially establish an "individual rights" interpretation of the Second Amendment.
               <p>
               In <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> (2008), the Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm, unconnected to service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home within many longstanding prohibitions and restrictions on firearms possession listed by the Court as being consistent with the Second Amendment.
               <p>
               In <em>McDonald v. Chicago</em> (2010) the Court ruled that the Second Amendment limits state and local governments to the same extent that it limits the federal government.
               <p>
            <li>The Second Amendment is the only amendment to the Constitution which states a purpose.<sup>[1]</sup>
