	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>Under the original procedure for the Electoral College, as provided in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, each elector could vote for two persons. The two people chosen by the elector could not both inhabit the same state as that elector. This prohibition was designed to keep electors from voting for two "favorite sons" of their respective states. The person receiving the greatest number of votes, provided that number equalled a majority of the electors, was elected President.
               <p>
               If there was more than one individual who received the same number of votes, and such number equaled a majority of the electors, the House of Representatives would choose one of them to be President. If no individual had a majority, then the House of Representatives would choose from the five individuals with the greatest number of electoral votes.
               <p>
               Selecting the Vice President was a simpler process. Whichever candidate received the greatest number of votes, except for the one elected President, became Vice President. In the event of a tie for second place among multiple candidates, the Senate would choose one of them to be Vice President.
               <p>
            <li>The Twelfth Amendment changed the process whereby a President and a Vice President are elected. It was becoming increasingly apparent that a situation in which the Vice President had been a defeated electoral opponent of the President would impede the ability of the two to effectively work together, and could provide motivation, at least in theory, for a coup d'Ã©tat (since the Vice President would succeed to the office of President upon the removal or death of the President).
                <p>
                In allowing for the President and Vice President to be elected as a ticket (without the tie electoral vote as happened in 1800), the Twelfth Amendment eliminated this possibility, or at least minimized it by lessening the Vice President's motivation for staging such a coup.
