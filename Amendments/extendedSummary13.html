	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>President Lincoln and other Republicans were concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation, which in 1863 declared the freedom of slaves in ten Confederate states then in rebellion, would be seen as a temporary war measure, since it was based solely on Lincoln's war powers. The Proclamation did not free any slaves in the border states nor did it abolish slavery. Because of this, Lincoln and other supporters believed that an amendment to the Constitution was needed.
               <p>
            <li>The Senate passed the amendment on April 8, 1864, by a vote of 38 to 6. However, just over two months later on June 15, the House failed to do so, with 93 in favor and 65 against, thirteen votes short of the two-thirds vote needed for passage.
                <p>
                President Lincoln took an active role in working for its passage through the House by ensuring the amendment was added to the Republican Party platform for the 1864 presidential election and using his powers adroitly.
                <p>Finally, after seven months of debate and promises of patronage, the House narrowly reached the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill on January 31, 1865, by a vote of 119 to 56.
                <p>
            <li>Shortly after the amendment's adoption, selective enforcement of certain laws, such as laws against vagrancy, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_(United_States)">Black Codes</a>, resulted in blacks continuing to be subjected to involuntary servitude in some cases, particularly in the South.
                <p>
                Southern states hired out prisoners to private companies and interests as convict lease labor to pay off court fees for such offenses. As these states made the lessees responsible for the prisoners' food, clothing and housing, these states did not build any prisons until late in the nineteenth century. Law enforcement and businessmen colluded to entrap freedmen and convict them, so they could gain revenues from convict lease labor.
