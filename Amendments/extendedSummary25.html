	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_6:_Vacancy_and_disability">Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution</a> is unclear regarding Presidential succession and inability; it does not state who has the power to declare a President incapacitated. Also, it does not provide a mechanism for filling a Vice Presidential vacancy prior to the next Presidential election. The vagueness of this clause caused difficulties many times before the Twenty-fifth Amendment's adoption:
               <p>
               <ol>
                   <li>In 1841, President William Henry Harrison became the first U.S. President to die in office. Representative John Williams had previously suggested that the Vice President should become Acting President upon the death of the President.<sup>[1]</sup> Vice President John Tyler asserted that he had succeeded to the office of President, as opposed to only obtaining its powers and duties. He also declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as "Acting President". Despite some strong calls against it, Tyler took the oath of office as the tenth President. Tyler's claim was not formally challenged and so the precedent of full succession was established.<sup>[2]</sup> This became known as the "Tyler Precedent".
                       <p>
                    <li>There had been many occasions when a President was incapacitated. For example, following President Wilson's stroke no one officially assumed the Presidential powers and duties.
                        <p>
                    <li>The office of Vice President had been vacant sixteen times due to the death or resignation of either the President or Vice President. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly four years after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
               </ol>
               <p>
               All of these incidents made it evident that clearer guidelines were needed.
               <p>
               
            <li>On January 6, 1965, Senator Birch Bayh proposed in the Senate and Representative Emanuel Celler (Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee) proposed in the House of Representatives what would become the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Their proposal specified the process by which a President could be declared disabled, thereby making the Vice President an Acting President, and how the President could regain the powers of his office. Also, their proposal provided a way to fill a vacancy in the office of Vice President before the next presidential election. This was as opposed to the Keatingâ€“Kefauver proposal (an earlier proposal), which did not provide for filling a vacancy in the office of Vice President prior to the next presidential election or itself provide a process for determining presidential disability. In 1964, the American Bar Association endorsed the type of proposal which Bayh and Celler advocated.
