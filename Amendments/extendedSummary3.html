    <h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
            <li>The British Quartering Acts, requiring the American colonies to pay the costs of British soldiers serving in the colonies, were one of the Intolerable Acts which led to the Revolutionary War.
                <p>
            <li>The Third Amendment is among the least cited sections of the U.S. Constitution. There have been no major Supreme Court cases concerning violations of the Third Amendment, mainly because the quartering it forbids has not been attempted since the American Revolution.
                <p>
            <li>The Third Amendment has been invoked to argue an implicit right to privacy and limitation on executive power in the Constitution. 
       </ul>
