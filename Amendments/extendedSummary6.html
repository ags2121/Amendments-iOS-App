    <h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>The rights protected under the Sixth Amendment include the right of a criminal defendant to a speedy trial and a public trial; the right to an impartial jury; the right to be tried in the state where the crime was committed; the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the criminal accusation; as well as rights protected under the Confrontation Clause, Compulsory Process Clause, and the Assistance of Counsel Clause.
                <p>
            <li>The right to counsel is applied mainly to criminal cases, and to only a few civil cases, namely, "involuntary-commitment and competency proceedings; abuse, neglect, dependency and termination-of-parental-rights hearings; and any proceeding involving a limitation on freedom of movement or access, such as satelite monitoring for registered sex offenders." Most of the civil legal needs of the poor go unmet as there is no right to counsel for the majority of civil cases, such as cases involving "domestic violence, divorce, child custody, housing, consumer protection, employment, benefits and health care.<sup>1</sup>
                <p>
            <li>The Confrontation Clause is so named because it requires that the defendant be confronted with the witnesses who are testifying against him. The rationale is that the defendant had no opportunity to challenge the credibility of and cross-examine the person making the statements if the person is not present; in other words the clause is meant to prevent the admission of hearsay in court.
