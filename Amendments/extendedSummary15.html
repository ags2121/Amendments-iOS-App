	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>The Fifteenth Amendment is the third of the Reconstruction Amendments. It prohibits the federal government and the states from using a citizen's race, color, or previous status as a slave as a voting qualification.
               <p>
               Before the Fifteenth Amendment, laws throughout the country restricted the franchise to whites, or else granted a precarious right to vote to blacks. For example, after the North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the right of free men of color to vote in the state, amendments to the North Carolina Constitution removed the right in 1835.
               <p>
               Early versions of the amendment posed serious challenges in being ratified by three-fourths of the states. A handful of states still required voters and candidates to be Christian. Southern Republicans saw a value in continuing loyalty tests, which the Reconstruction state governments used to limit the influence of ex-Confederates; and Democrats in some Northern and Western states wanted to continue to be able to disenfranchise non-native Irish and Chinese.
               <p>
               The different versions of amendment were produced. The first of these prohibited states from denying citizens the vote because of their race, color, or the previous experience of being a slave. The second version prevented states from denying the vote to anyone based on literacy, property, or the circumstances of their birth. The third version stated plainly and directly that all male citizens who were 21 or older had the right to vote. Congress decided that using the first version would be the most effective and most likely to pass because it was the most moderate.
               <p>
               <li>Thomas Mundy Peterson was the first African American to vote after the amendment's adoption. Peterson cast his ballot in an election over whether to revise the city of Perth Amboy's charter or abandon it for a township form of government. His vote was cast at City Hall in Perth Amboy, New Jersey on March 31, 1870.
                   <p>
                   On a per capita and absolute basis, more blacks were elected to public office during the period from 1865 to 1880 than at any other time in American history including a number of state legislatures which were effectively under the control of a strong African American caucus. For example. the first post-Civil War legislature in South Carolina was 87 blacks to 40 whites. In southern states, the total number of white registered was about 600,000 while blacks were about 703,400. In the 1870 census, blacks outnumbered whites in terms of total population in Mississippi, Louisiana, and South Carolina.
