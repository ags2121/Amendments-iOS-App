	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li><em>Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.</em> (1895) was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court  ruled that the unapportioned income taxes on interest, dividends and rents imposed by the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act (1894) were, in effect, direct taxes, and were unconstitutional because they violated the provision that direct taxes be apportioned.
               <p>
               The plaintiff Charles Pollock was a Massachusetts citizen who owned only ten shares of stock in the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company. Pollock sued the company for acting in compliance with the income tax provision of the Tariff Act, which required that, for a five-year period, any "gains, profits and incomes" in excess of $4,000 would be taxed at 2%.
               <p>
               The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Pollock, treating tax on income from property as a direct tax. Under the provisions of the Constitution at that time, direct taxes, such as the income tax, were required to be imposed in proportion to states' population. The tax on the income from the stock had not been apportioned and, therefore, was rendered invalid. =
               <p>
               The Sixteenth Amendment nullified this ruling; it permitted Congress to enact an income tax and removed the issue of apportionment from the debate.
               <p>
            <li>Supporters of the income tax believed that it would be a much better method of gathering revenue than tariffs, which were the primary source of revenue at the time. They argued that tariffs disproportionately affected the poor, interfered with prices, were unpredictable, and were an intrinsically limited source of revenue.
                <p>
                The South and the West tended to support income taxes because their residents were generally less prosperous, more agricultural and more sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. A sharp rise in the cost of living between 1897 and 1913 greatly increased support for the idea of income taxes, including in the urban Northeast where opposition was strongest.
                <p>
                A growing number of Republicans also began supporting the idea, notably Theodore Roosevelt. These Republicans were driven mainly by a fear of the increasingly large and sophisticated military forces of Japan, Britain and the European powers, their own imperial ambitions and the perceived need to defend American merchant ships.
                <p>
                Moreover, these progressive Republicans were, as the name suggests, convinced that central governments could play a positive role in national economies; a bigger government and a bigger military, of course, required a correspondingly larger and steadier source of revenue to support it.
