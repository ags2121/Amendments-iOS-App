	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li><em>Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.</em> (1895) was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court  ruled that the unapportioned income taxes on interest, dividends and rents imposed by the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act (1894) were, in effect, direct taxes, and were unconstitutional because they violated the provision that direct taxes be apportioned. The plaintiff Charles Pollock was a Massachusetts citizen who owned only ten shares of stock in the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company. Pollock sued the company for acting in compliance with the income tax provision of the Tariff Act, which required that, for a five-year period, any "gains, profits and incomes" in excess of $4,000 would be taxed at 2%. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Pollock, treating tax on income from property as a direct tax. Under the provisions of the Constitution at that time, direct taxes, such as the income tax, were required to be imposed in proportion to states' population. The tax on the income from the stock had not been apportioned and, therefore, was rendered invalid. The Sixteenth Amendment nullified this ruling; it permitted Congress to enact an income tax and removed the issue of apportionment from the debate.
