	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
            <li>Opposition to the ratification of the Constitution was partly based on its lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties.
                <p>
                To provide such guarantees, the First Amendment (along with the rest of the Bill of Rights) was submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789, and adopted on December 15, 1791.
                <p>
            <li>Originally, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress. However, starting with <em>Gitlow v. New York</em> (1925) the Supreme Court has applied the First Amendment to each state. This was done through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, by what is called the Incorporation Doctrine. The Court has also recognized a series of exceptions to provisions protecting the freedom of speech.
                <p>
            <li>The First Amendment was one of the first guarantees of religious freedom: neither the English Bill of Rights, nor the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, contains a similar guarantee.
       </ul>
