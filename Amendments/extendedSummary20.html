	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>Section 1 of the amendment reduced the amount of time between Election Day and the beginning of Presidential, Vice Presidential and Congressional terms.
               <p>
               Originally, the terms of the President, the Vice President and the incoming Congress began on March 4, four months after the elections were held. While this lapse was a practical necessity at the end of the 18th century, when any newly-elected official might require several months to put his affairs in order and then undertake an arduous journey from his home to the national capital, it eventually had the effect of impeding the functioning of government in the modern age.
               <p>
            <li>From the early 19th century onward, it also meant that a lame duck Congress or Presidential administration could fail to adequately respond to a significant national crisis in a timely manner.
                <p>
                Each institution could do this on the theory that at best, a lame duck Congress or administration had neither the time nor the mandate to tackle problems, whereas the incoming administration or Congress would have both the time, and a fresh electoral mandate, to examine and address the problems that the nation faced. These problems very likely would have been at the center of the debate of the just completed election cycle.
                <p>
                This dilemma was seen most notably in 1861 and 1933, after the elections of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively, plus the newly elected Senators and Representatives. Under the Constitution at the time, these presidents had to wait four months before they, and the incoming Congresses, could deal with the secession of Southern states and the Great Depression respectively.
                   <p>
            <li>Additionally the amendment specifies that if the Electoral College fails to resolve who will be the President or Vice President, the incoming Congress, as opposed to the outgoing one, would choose who would occupy the unresolved office or offices.
