    <h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
            <li>The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that generally a warrant must be judicially sanctioned for a search or an arrest. In order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable, it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person (usually a law enforcement officer) who has sworn by it and is therefore accountable to the issuing court.
                <p>
            <li>One way courts enforce the Fourth Amendment is through the use of the exclusionary rule, which provides that evidence obtained through a violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally not admissible. The Court adopted the exclusionary rule in <em>Weeks v. United States</em> (1914), prior to which all evidence, no matter how seized, could be admitted in court.
                <p>
            <li>Over the last decade, courts adjudicated whether the government can access evidence of illegal activity stored on digital technology without violating the Fourth Amendment. In <em>Rehberg v. Paulk</em> the court ruled that a person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in an email once any copy of the communication is delivered to a third party; in <em>United States v. Warshak</em>, the court ruled that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his emails and that the government violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights by compelling his internet service provider to turn over his emails without first obtaining a warrant.
