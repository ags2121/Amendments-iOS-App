	<h3>Extended Summary</h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>The Eleventh Amendment was adopted in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in <em>Chisholm v. Georgia</em> (1793).
               <p>
               In <em>Chisholm</em>, the Court ruled that federal courts had the authority to hear cases in law and equity brought by private citizens against states and that states did not enjoy sovereign immunity from suits made by citizens of other states in federal court.
               <p>
               In this way, the amendment clarified Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which gave diversity jurisdiction to the judiciary to hear cases "between a state and citizens of another state."
               <p>
            <li>Although the Eleventh Amendment immunizes states from suit for money damages or equitable relief without their consent, there are a few cases where states can be liable.
                <p>
                In <em>Ex parte Young</em> (1908) the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts may enjoin state officials from violating federal law.
                <p>In <em>Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer</em> (1976) the Supreme Court ruled that Congress may abrogate state immunity from suit under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
                <p>In <em>Central Virginia Community College v. Katz</em> (2006) the Court ruled the Congress could do the same regarding bankruptcy cases by way of Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution.
                <p>Also, in <em>Lapides v. Board of Regents of Univ. System of Ga.</em> (2002) the Supreme Court ruled that a state voluntarily waives the Eleventh Amendment when it invokes a federal court's removal jurisdiction.
